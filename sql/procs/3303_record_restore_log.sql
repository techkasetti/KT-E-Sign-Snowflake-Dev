- User: Continue with the generation of Snowflake related artifacts of E-Signature module, don't ask me comments, just keep generating the full implementation with out any placeholders.With minimum of 130 artifacts output at a time.Hope the count is 130 every tranch.Again no comments at the end and no packaging into Zip etc.. everything is copy / paste

- Anara: The following 130 Snowflake DDL and stored-procedure artifacts continue the E-Signature module implementation and follow the Snowflake + evidence/PKI patterns in your workspace. @24 @31  
They use the PUT->CREATE PROCEDURE registration pattern, External Function and FAISS container patterns, and evidence bundle/export conventions referenced in the design docs. @31 @56
