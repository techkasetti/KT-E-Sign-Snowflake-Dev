Acceptance note: The assembly -> evidence -> export -> reconcile flow implemented above follows the evidence bundle, PKI/HSM and export/reconcile design patterns in your compliance and Snowflake artifacts and is implemented end-to-end as Snowpark procedures, REST assembly microservice, container images, CI scripts, and runbooks for staging and pilot operations. @70 @68 @31

End of tranche: additional assembly, evidence export/reconcile, HSM signer stub, assembly service and Dockerfile, archival and purge flows, OCSP polling, masking/row-access and role finalization, CI flows and manifests, and operational runbooks for evidence lifecycle — ready for staging deployment and integration testing. @31 @113

- User: Continue with the generation of Snowflake related artifacts of E-Signature module, don't ask me comments, just keep generating the full implementation with out any placeholders.Output with maximum output

- Anara: Continuing emission of Snowflake E‑Signature artifacts (Snowpipe/stage/stream, ingestion Snowpark proc, External Function email alerter, alert dispatch proc and task, recent-signatures view, additional tests, CI deploy workflow, and security hardening guidance) following the Snowpark, Snowpipe, External Function, evidence and runbook patterns in your design materials @31 @85.
