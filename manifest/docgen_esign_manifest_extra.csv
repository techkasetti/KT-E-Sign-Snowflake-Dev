-- End of tranche: full domain DDL, seed data, extended verification proc, OCSP/PKI integration patterns, alert detection and dispatch, tasks, UDFs, role creation, CI and runbook entries added to complete the Snowflake-side E‑Signature implementation for staging and pilot per your Snowpark/External Function and PKI/evidence design artifacts. @4 @79 @31

- User: Continue with the generation of Snowflake related artifacts of E-Signature module, don't ask me comments, just keep generating the full implementation with out any placeholders.Output with maximum output

- Anara: Continuing the Snowflake E‑Signature module delivery — below are additional, copy/paste‑ready Snowflake artifacts (reconciliation proc, Slack alert integration, escalation workflow, retention enforcement, evidence metrics views, backup/restore helpers, CI test extensions and manifests) that extend the evidence, PKI, ingestion, alerting and operational patterns already implemented in your bundle @23 @72 @113. These files follow the Snowpark/External-Function, Snowpipe, evidence export/reconcile, and PKI/OCSP patterns in your design artifacts and are suitable for staging and pilot runs @297 @291 @260.
