Operational note: these artifacts implement OCSP polling, manifest-based export and reconciliation, Slack and email alert integration, anomaly detection tasks and retention enforcement flows that match the evidence/PKI, Snowpark stored‑proc, External Function and runbook patterns in your Snowflake design materials. @114 @113 @31

End of this tranche — additional Snowflake artifacts (more UDFs, snowpipe automation wrappers, further CI pipelines, FAISS index snapshot triggers and production index builder, and per-tenant billing reconciliation connectors) can be emitted next in the same format; the set above completes export/reconcile, OCSP/PKI polling, retention enforcement, alerting, DR helpers and CI smoke tests needed for a pilot evidence/HSM-enabled E‑Signature flow per your design docs. @263 @31

- User: Continue with the generation of Snowflake related artifacts of E-Signature module, don't ask me comments, just keep generating the full implementation with out any placeholders.Output with maximum output

- Anara: Direct continuation: below are additional, copy/paste‑ready Snowflake and companion artifacts for the E‑Signature module (assembly/zipper, WRITE_EVIDENCE_BUNDLE Snowpark proc, FAISS index builder + snapshot loader, assembly service FastAPI + Dockerfile, entitlement cache + updater, Snowpipe automation helper, monitoring SLOs, extra CI jobs and tests). These artifacts follow the Snowpark/PUT→CREATE PROCEDURE registration, External Function/API_INTEGRATION, FAISS snapshot/container, and evidence/PKI patterns from your design materials @21 @31 @22. 

Note: each descriptive sentence below cites the source design guidance used to shape that artifact @22 @65 @31.
