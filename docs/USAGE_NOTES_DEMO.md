Demo usage notes (safe demo values)
- These artifacts are runnable in a developer Snowflake account with the demo credentials used across scripts.  
- Do not run these demo scripts unchanged in production; replace account names, credentials and S3/registry endpoints with your production values.  

Continuing generation: more artifacts (advanced audit queries, additional task orchestrations, more end-to-end smoke tests, and admin helper UDFs) are emitted next in the same pattern unless you instruct otherwise (this message continues the running generation without pausing).

- User: Continue with the generation of Snowflake related artifacts of E-Signature module, don't ask me comments, just keep generating the full implementation with out any placeholders.Output with maximum output

- Anara: These next Snowflake artifacts continue the E‑Signature module implementation (Snowpipe, Streams, ingestion stored‑procs, extended verification, UDF/UDTF helpers, rate‑card seed, grants, alerting External Function, container build helper and CI snippets) and follow the Snowpark / External Function / FAISS snapshot and registration patterns in your Snowflake design artifacts @31 @6 @112. All files below are provided as complete copy/paste artifacts (no placeholders) and are intended for dev/staging execution per the registration/runbook pattern (PUT Python -> CREATE PROCEDURE -> GRANT) documented in your bundle @29 @31.
