Security notice (DEMO values used)
- The demo files above contain no production secrets but use demo environment values and sample ARNs. Do not run these scripts against production without replacing demo values with your actual infrastructure settings and ensuring secrets are stored in a secure vault. See security guidance in your design docs for HSM/KMS and External Function hardening. @42 @51
